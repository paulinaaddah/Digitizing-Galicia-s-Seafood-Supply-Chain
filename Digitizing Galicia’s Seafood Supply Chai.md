Digitizing Galicia’s Seafood Supply Chain: Solving Operational and Quality Control Challenges through Smart Systems

Introduction:
The seafood industry in Galicia faces persistent operational inefficiencies and trust issues rooted in manual handling, inconsistent quality standards, and lack of real-time visibility. This article explores how digitization and AI-driven tools can transform seafood warehousing operations by addressing specific, observed problems through cost-effective, transparent, and efficient systems.

1. Damaged Seafood and Cold Chain Failures
Shipments often arrive with unusable, dead seafood due to poor temperature control during transport. In one instance, 1.36kg was logged as waste. This not only leads to financial loss but affects client trust in product consistency.
Solution: Install a visual inspection station with AI detection that flags spoilage based on physical features like dull color, cracked shells, or cloudy eyes. Supplement with real-time temperature tracking tools (like GPS-enabled thermologgers) and condition logs to monitor cold chain breaches.

2. Mixed Size Categorization and Unfair Pricing
Vendors label batches as "mediana" even when filled with small sizes, by adding just a few larger pieces. For example, 45 small pieces were found in 1kg labeled “mediana,” creating unjust pricing inflation.
Solution: Standardize sizing using a count-per-kilo system and visual grading models. Implement a digital photo-based grading guide and AI-based classifier to instantly verify size at weighing stations. This ensures consistency and eliminates manipulation.

3. False Grading Practices
Suppliers often disguise low-value products as premium by mixing in a few high-quality items to label a batch as "grande." This undermines fair pricing and creates supplier distrust.
Solution: Deploy smart cameras that analyze the entire batch and calculate the dominant grade based on majority composition. Store grading results with timestamped images in a digital supplier accountability system. Enforce a grading contract based on agreed visual standards.

4. Lack of Consistent Size Classification Logic
There are no clear benchmarks for what qualifies as “small,” “medium,” or “large,” leading to subjective interpretations. This inconsistency directly impacts pricing, quality control, and customer satisfaction.
Solution: Develop a clear visual and numeric grading chart displayed at the warehouse. Train an AI model to recognize these categories based on images captured at intake. This builds a traceable, reliable standard for classification and strengthens supplier compliance.

5. Delayed Deliveries and Manual Documentation
Printed sheets arrive late, forcing staff to work overtime just to update records. Manually entering weights, matching tanks, and sending delivery updates slows operations and causes errors.
Solution: Replace all paperwork with a real-time digital dashboard. Suppliers can upload batch details before arrival. Use Slack or WhatsApp integration for alerts and approvals, and synchronize data with a central record system for end-of-day reports.

6. Manual Messaging and Entry Workload
Operations staff spend unnecessary time messaging suppliers, weighing items, and cross-referencing tank data. These repetitive tasks delay productivity and create room for human error.
Solution: Build a lightweight mobile or web app with supplier QR codes. Scanning auto-fills weight and origin data, attaches batch images, and generates digital receipts. The app should also auto-send delivery confirmation to all relevant parties.

7. Lack of Supplier Issue Tracking
There's no system to track which suppliers consistently deliver poor-quality goods, mix sizes, or cause delays. This weakens negotiation leverage and wastes money over time.
Solution: Implement a supplier performance dashboard that logs every batch: condition, grade accuracy, timeliness, and spoilage percentage. Generate monthly reports that rank suppliers and support decision-making for future orders or replacements.

Cross-Cutting Impact Areas:

Operational Efficiency:
Digital dashboards, AI grading, and automated messaging reduce manual effort, improve batch intake speed, and cut overtime hours.

Financial Accuracy and Cost-Effectiveness:
Eliminating false grading and spoilage reduces losses. Real-time detection helps reclaim refunds or demand fair pricing.

Trust and Transparency:
Storing supplier data, images, and conditions builds evidence-based accountability and encourages honest dealing.

Quality Control Assurance:
Defining and enforcing clear grading standards ensures product consistency, improving end-client satisfaction and reputation.

Conclusion:
By digitizing core parts of the seafood warehouse workflow—grading, documentation, supplier interaction, and quality tracking—Galicia’s seafood industry can move toward a smarter, fairer, and more efficient future. These transformations are not just about automation, but about protecting value, improving labor conditions, and building trust across the supply chain.
