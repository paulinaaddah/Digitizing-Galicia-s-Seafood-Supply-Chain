 DevOps to Dockside: How Galicia’s Waters Changed My Tech Mission

When I landed in Spain in 2021, I came in as a DevOps and Cloud Engineer—ambitious, prepared, and eager to continue my career in a new country. Back in Ghana, I had led and digitized systems for various industries, including a car assembly plant as far back as 2011. I was used to spotting inefficiencies and building automated, scalable, cost-effective solutions. But settling in Galicia shifted everything.

I’ll be honest. Like most Ghanaians, my knowledge of Spain was limited to what I knew through football—Madrid and Barcelona. Galicia wasn’t even on the map for me until I arrived. But when I got here, I found a province wrapped in sea and nature. Its calm beaches, fishing ports, and beautiful coastal towns were unlike anything I had seen. I would walk around admiring the shoreline, unaware that it would soon become central to my new mission.

Even though I was already qualified, getting into Spain’s tech job market wasn’t straightforward. I was actively interviewing with recruiters for DevOps and cloud roles, but the language barrier was real. Many positions required fluent Spanish, and I was still learning. A few roles asked for only basic Spanish, but even those were rare. So I did what any resilient engineer would do—I got to work. I accepted a role at a seafood warehouse to earn a living, but I didn’t leave my tech instincts at home.

My first few days at the warehouse were shocking. The onboarding process was entirely verbal, no documented handover, no digital SOPs. I had to memorize every instruction and jump straight into action. I watched as everything—delivery logs, supplier notes, batch IDs—were scribbled on papers that were easily damaged by water or lost in the chaos of handling seafood. One day, a paper with a critical batch number fell into a tank. I didn’t realize it until later, and I had to frantically place it on a heater to dry, hoping it wouldn’t completely erase. That moment stayed with me. It wasn’t just about wet paper. It was about how fragile the entire process was.

Coming from the Ashanti Region in Ghana, where we’re landlocked, the only seafood I was familiar with were species like tilapia, salmon, octopus, and shrimp. Here in Galicia, I encountered names I’d never heard—navaja, longueirón, ameixa fina, percebe, and many others. Each species had its own handling protocol, storage temperature, and tank management routine. There were no guides or manuals, and the staff relied mostly on what they already knew. Sometimes, I had to sneak to a corner, Google the seafood name, or find a YouTube video just to understand what I was holding.

Despite the stress, I saw something deeper—an entire system dependent on verbal communication, intuition, and handwritten records, yet moving tons of delicate products daily. It reminded me of the car assembly line I once digitized. The same lack of visibility, the same exposure to human error, and the same financial losses were happening here, only this time it was seafood. And just like then, I couldn’t unsee it.

I began taking notes. I studied the flow—what comes in, who records what, where the delays happen, what tools break down often. I observed patterns: size mislabeling, supplier inconsistencies, and cold chain failures. But I also saw opportunity. I knew what cloud automation could do. I knew how machine learning could detect seafood size and spoilage. I knew how QR codes and IoT could solve tracking and predictive maintenance. It stopped being just a warehouse job. It became a live DevOps challenge—one that I had to solve from the inside.

This project isn’t about seafood. It’s about systems. It’s about what happens when tech and industry meet—when someone who understands infrastructure and automation is placed where chaos is normalized. I didn’t choose seafood. But Galicia’s sea chose me to see its gaps. And now, it’s not just about earning a living. It’s about building something that lasts—something scalable, cost-effective, automated, and intelligent enough to transform how seafood moves from boat to buyer.

**Introduction: From Local Gaps to Global Patterns**

Galicia’s seafood industry is world-renowned, supplying vast quantities of shellfish and fish across Europe and beyond. Yet behind its reputation for quality lies a supply chain that remains heavily reliant on paper-based processes, subjective grading, and manual coordination. These outdated methods lead to operational inefficiencies, financial waste, and a breakdown in trust between suppliers and buyers. From receiving dead products due to broken cold chains to facing unfair pricing tactics through inconsistent size labeling, warehouse staff are burdened with correcting problems that digital tools can now prevent.

Recent national reforms have added urgency to Galicia’s digitization. In 2025, the Spanish government introduced a labor law reducing the workweek to 37.5 hours and mandating digital time-tracking systems across all industries. Though primarily aimed at labor compliance, this law sends a clear message: businesses must digitize their operations to remain compliant, competitive, and transparent. For the seafood industry, this is a critical opportunity to reimagine how products are received, tracked, graded, and priced.

A key issue at the warehouse level is the arrival of dead or damaged seafood due to cold chain failures. In a single instance, 1.36kg of unusable product was logged, contributing to financial loss and raising questions about quality control. This can be addressed by installing a real-time visual inspection system at the receiving point, equipped with cameras and AI trained to detect spoilage indicators such as shell cracks, color dullness, or cloudy eyes. To support this, thermal tracking sensors—like GPS-enabled thermologgers—can be added to delivery boxes to record transport conditions and expose cold chain failures. These data points, timestamped and stored digitally, serve as proof for refund claims or renegotiation with suppliers.

Equally pressing is the lack of standardization in size grading. Vendors routinely mislabel shipments—mixing smaller seafood into “mediana” or “grande” grades—to inflate pricing. Without a visual baseline, warehouse staff have no choice but to manually sort and challenge discrepancies, often under time pressure. Here, a simple machine learning model hosted on SageMaker or Teachable Machine, trained with standardized images of seafood size categories, can be integrated into an edge device like a Raspberry Pi with a webcam. When seafood is placed on the tray, the model classifies dominant sizes and flags mismatches between supplier-declared and actual grade. It also logs the confidence score and stores annotated photos to build long-term supplier performance reports.

These inconsistencies create compounding issues—financially and reputationally. Unfair pricing eats into margin, manual correction slows processing, and buyers lose trust in origin transparency. By building a real-time grading validation engine, you ensure data integrity at the receiving point, which flows upstream to delivery invoices, quality reports, and client transparency dashboards. This is not about replacing staff—it’s about augmenting them with tools that reduce friction, boost confidence, and support accountability.

Predictive maintenance is another blind spot. In the span of a single week, the label printer that was crucial for tank tagging broke down, forcing handwritten batch IDs and delivery tags. Forklifts and weighing equipment also suffer repeated interruptions due to wear and tear, but without any monitoring in place. This results in downtime, delay in sorting, and manual rework. Attaching basic IoT sensors to key machines and connecting them to AWS Greengrass or Prometheus enables vibration and usage monitoring. Alerts are pushed when anomalies are detected, allowing for timely repairs and reducing disruption.

None of these problems exist in isolation—they are symptoms of a system still running on fragile infrastructure. But each is also an entry point for digital intervention. When DevOps principles meet operational chaos, every pain point becomes an automation opportunity, every manual task a candidate for intelligent orchestration.

In Iceland, a fully digitized seafood supply chain now serves as a global benchmark. Their ability to track fish from sea to shelf, with real-time temperature monitoring and AI-based quality classification, has helped cut seafood waste by over 30% and improved buyer confidence. In Spain, Pescanova's integration of blockchain and IoT for monitoring seafood handling and transport conditions is already showing that digitization can be adopted even in traditional setups. These cases prove that digital transformation is not exclusive to large corporations. It’s scalable and practical—even at warehouse level.

For Galicia’s seafood network, the transformation is not just possible—it is essential. A modernized intake system could use React for real-time dashboards, AWS Lambda and API Gateway for backend events, DynamoDB for traceable records, Rekognition for image processing, and IoT Core for sensor feeds. Staff training would include integrated guides, retraining cycles for AI models, and localized support. GitHub Actions and Terraform would ensure CI/CD for evolving infrastructure, while Amazon QuickSight or Grafana would visualize supplier performance and equipment uptime.

This is what it means to treat a seafood warehouse like a digital product. High availability, fault tolerance, traceability, and cost-efficiency—terms once reserved for cloud systems—are now tools to anchor real-world logistics. The future of Galicia’s seafood economy will not only depend on what’s caught, but on how it’s tracked, graded, preserved, and delivered. It’s time to build that system. And it starts from here.
