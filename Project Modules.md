Module 1: Digital Intake Dashboard
Goal: Replace paper-based delivery sheets with real-time digital entry.

Build a React frontend with intake form: supplier name, species, size, weight, condition, tank assignment.

Backend: AWS Lambda + API Gateway

Database: DynamoDB (auto timestamped, versioned entries)

Integrate WhatsApp/Slack alerts when a new entry is made.

Module 2: AI Grading System (Size Classification)
Goal: Auto-detect seafood size category to prevent mislabeling.

Use a camera + Raspberry Pi or webcam.

Train model with Teachable Machine or deploy custom model via AWS SageMaker.

Classify: small / mediana / grande based on visual majority.

Output: category + confidence + image log saved in S3.

Module 3: Spoilage Detection and Cold Chain Logging
Goal: Identify damaged seafood and detect cold chain failure.

Visual AI trained to detect cracks, discoloration, limpness.

Add GPS thermologger (or mock sensor feed) to delivery boxes.

Integrate with AWS IoT Core to log temperature data.

Alert system via Amazon SNS if thresholds breached.

Module 4: Predictive Maintenance Monitoring
Goal: Monitor label printers, forklifts, and scales for early fault detection.

Install basic IoT sensors (vibration or current draw) to each key device.

Connect to Prometheus or AWS Greengrass.

Stream data to Grafana or CloudWatch.

Trigger Slack/Email alert if unusual activity is detected.

Module 5: Supplier Performance Dashboard
Goal: Track supplier quality, punctuality, and consistency.

Pull data from DynamoDB entries and grading logs.

Use Amazon QuickSight or Grafana to visualize:

Late deliveries

Grade mismatches

Spoilage rates

Export monthly reports to PDF or email to admins.

Module 6: Infrastructure Automation (DevOps)
Goal: Manage all infrastructure as code with auditability.

Use Terraform to provision AWS resources.

Set up GitHub Actions for CI/CD (auto-deploy frontend + backend).

Monitor deployment changes with AWS CloudTrail or Terraform state diffs.

Version control all Lambda and frontend code in GitHub.
